# MapParking
MapParking is a proof-of-concept project utilizing Ultrasonic Sensors to detect availability of parking spots in the neighborhood. The sensors would be attached to parking meters and can sense the presence or absence of cars directly in front of them. The sensors data are being transmitted over via SigFox network, a public wireless network dedicated to the Internet of Things, whose technology excels at providing a network for small packets of data and enables longer battery life and cheaper chips and plans. Park spaces availability will be mapped to the Google API and deployed on Heroku.
